Data::Fallback is a very generous version 0.01.  I have great vision for it, but for now, I am just starting.  Here is a list of
at least a bit of my vision.

- write a better perldoc for Data::Fallback
- write perldocs for each Data::Fallback:: package
- allow use of Cache::Cache
- get a good last used algorithm going
- get a better protocol for Data::Fallback::Daemon
- allow XML interface for Data::Fallback::Daemon
- get some Soap::Lite going
- help speed up Net::Server stuff, to say a thousand local requests a second on a say dual ghz+ machine
- write Data::Fallback::Skel, which outlines how to write a general Data::Fallback package

With the above, you would be able to cache pretty well any data, from pretty well any source, get it locally very fast and 
use any language you like.

And there, is my Data::Fallback vision.
